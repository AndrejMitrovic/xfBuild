MAJOR TODO: xfbuild doesn't understand /core/ modules

xfbuild depends on existing .deps file, but this becomes a problem when building individual projects,
as older __main symbols get put in. TODO THIS NOW.

If an exe already exists that was set up with +o, fail compilation immediately or overwrite based
on a setting.

+ Stop using abort() on compilation errors.
